# Inspiration
We all know that self care is very important, in every aspect of it. But, very often doing it and carrying on with your self care routine doesn't feel as easy as it sounds. That's what we wanted to solve. Things become easy and fun if they're aesthetic, and they make you happy in the first place. Flaneur, /literally means a person who wanders around/ is an app made just for that. A cute polaroid themed app where you can do a bunch of things.
